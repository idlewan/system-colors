  System Colors Developer sidebar (for Firefox 57+)

  Goal of this extension: show the different system colors (and font sizes) that
  Firefox can pull through from the operating system theme.

  This is intended to help develop Web Extensions that respect the use of colors
  already present on the user's machine, i.e. to blend with the users' custom
  themes.
