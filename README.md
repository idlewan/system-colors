# System colors browser extension

This addon is a WebExtension aiming to visually see which colors are pulled by Firefox from the system theme.
It creates a sidebar where it lists all the [system colors keywords (see MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#system_colors) (one on each line, background color of the line is using the named color).
